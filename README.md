# SDLC
My learning of SDLC

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle
SDLC is used to overcome the conflicts between customer and software developer in the process of designing a process of developing a software product, to reduce the time and cost of designing software development design process.

Winstone Royce who was the director of Lockheed software technology center in Austin, Texas,and also the first person to tell about the waterfall model,created SDLC and Dr, Barry Boehm was extended the work of winstone Royce.

Standard definition of SDLC is the blueprint of software development process.Also SDLC is the process that we follow to create a new product fromstart to end.
Stages of SDLC are:

1.Requirements gathering

2.Designing

3.Implementation

4.Verification

5.Deployment and maintainance

1.Requirements gathering: Collecting of requirements from the customer. Here HR, Architect, Business owner were involved.

2.Designing: Designing will helps the developers to write code to build an application Ex: UI/UX designer.

3.Implementation: Developers start writting the code with help of designing a document given by designer, Here only developers will work.

4.Verification: It is the verification of applications that were developed. All types of testings will be done here. Ex: Testers will work here.

Deployment and maintainance: Giving thier product and providing further support to the customer. Here all the people in software development process depends upon need of an item will involved.

To implement SDLC, we have some models, they are:

1.Waterfall model

2.RAD(Random Application Development)model

3.Spiral model

4.v-model

5.Incremental model

6.Bigbag model

7.Agile model

8.prototype model

9.Iterative model

10.Devops

Waterfall model:

It is also called linear sequential life cycle model, it is one of the most widely used software development methodologies, and in this methodology every step in the waterfall model starts only when the preceding step completes.

The steps in waterfall model are:

Requirements gathering

Analysing requirements

Designing

Implementation

verification

monitoring

All steps in waterfall model are just like flow of water from upperside to downside.

Pros of waterfall model:

It is easy for doing complex applications, easy to understand, clearly defined stages.

Both process and results are documented well.

Cons of waterfall model:

Time taking process

Deployment time is more 

highly risk and uncertainity

we can't measure the progress within a stage

poor model for long and ongoing projects

modifications are not allowed once we move into further step

RAD(Rapid Application Development):

RAD is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favour of rapid prototyping.Protyping is a working model that is functionality equivalent to the component of the product.

It is a model based on both prototyping and iterative development with no specific planning involved.

In RAD model , the functional modules are developed in parallel as prototypes nad are integrate dto make complete product for faster product delivery.

pros:

progress can be measured 

Reduces development time

modifiactions are available

more work in less time with less people a

Encourages for customer feedback

Reusability of components

cons: 

skilled designers and developers are required

It doesn't available for cheaper projects 

user involvement is must throughout the lifecycle

suitable for the projects with shorter development times

The system that can be modularized can only be built using RAD

Spiral model:

spiral model is used for risk management that combines the iterative development process model with elements of waterfall model.It is favoured for large ,expensive and complicated projects.And it looks like a coil with more loops, the number of loops varies based on each project and is often designed by manager And each loop of spiral model is a phase in the software development process.

The main feature of this model is its ability to manage unknown risks after the project has commenced, creating a prototype makes this feasible .

In this spiral model, involves the following iteration :
Determine objectives --> Identify and resolve risks --> Development and test --> Plan the next iteration.

 Detailed design, code, integration, Test, Implementation are the steps involved in spiral model.
 
 In this model user can see the system early, allows extensive use of prototypes.
 
 It is not suitable for low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects.
 
 V-model:
 
 It is also called as verification and validation model.
 
 Requirements  --------------- Acceptance and system testing
   High level design ------- Integration testing
     Low level design --- unit testing
                Implementation    
                
 It is like waterfall model but the the v shaped lifecycle is a sequential path of execution of processes. 
 
 It is highly disciplined model. works well for smaller projects where requirements are well understood.
 
 It is not good Model for complex and object oriented projects.
 
 Incremental model:
 
 It is a process of software development where requirements divided into multiple stand alone modules of software development life cycle.Here each module goes through Requirements, design, implementation and testing phases.
 
 It is easy to test, debug and to recognige errors, more flexible, it is handled during iteration, the client gets important functionality early.
 
 Agile model:
 
 It is combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on customer satisfaction by fast delivering of software product, process of adaptability.
 
 Agile method breaks the product into small incremental builds, these builds are provided in interations. Each iteration involves crpss functional teams working simultaneously on various areas like planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing . 
 
 Most popular agile methodology, Agile manifesto principles are:
 
 Individuals and interactions
 
 Working software 
 
 customer collaboration
 
 Responding to change 

In agile, involves Requirements --> Design --> Develop --> Test--> Deploy.

Depending heavily on customer interaction. if the customer is not clear then whole team can be driven in the wrong direction.Individual dependency is high.

Iterative model:

Iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhances evolving versions until the full system is implemented.

The basuc idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles(iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental).

This model includes the software development requirements like Initialization, planning, Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Evaluation, Deployment.

It is not suitable small projects, End of the project may not be known which is a risk.

Bigbang model:

It is an SDLC model where we don't follow any specific process. 

The development starts with the required money and efforts as input , and output is the software developed which may or maynot be as per customer requirement.

This method is used for small/college/practice projects.

Prototype model:

It is a method revolves around the creation of low fedility prototype for the purpose of collecting early feedbackfrom the prospective users.from here prototype these are evolved into final software requirements.

It is best for the projects where requirements are not known in deatil.It's an iterative , trial and error vmethod which takes place between client and developer.

It is a combination of prototype development and iterative development.

Devops:

Devops is not a technical SDLC method but it does share the goal of maximizing software project success and includes agile inspired concepts. 

Devops is a set of practices that combines software devlopment and IT operations. It's main aim is to shorten the system devlopment lifecylce and to provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

It includes stages like Test--> Build--> Code--> Plan-->Monitor--> Operate--> Deploy--> Release.

Lean is to increase the speed and decrease the cost of product development.

5s of Lean workplace are sort--> set--> shine--> standardize--> sustain
